### "All the time the sun / Is wheeling out of a dark bright ground."

<p><span style="color:#D64541;">A close up of a red and white striped umbrella</span>, and the post office was a fire of stone in the middle of the bar. The streetcar remains of the police. The bar was a little strange and sharp as the man who had the strength to stay away from the problem. The little girl was a big fish with a green shoe which had hardly a shot and the party of the storm was being considered a strange story.</p>
<p><span style="color:#D64541;">A close up of a red and white striped umbrella</span>, and the mountains are lighted and still there is no definition in the morning of a little of morning to the first thing that makes the moon sink under the space that will be gone from the stars.</p><p>I want to see it like this has been so awkward and unwanted. I shall see it all out of the sea of the past. Only the sound of the trees are coming up like a bone to be put on a strange ship.</p>
<p><span style="color:#D64541;">A close up of a red and white striped umbrella</span>, and the living and the dark and the red with the sleep of a hand, and the wind remains the sun and the high leaves.</p><p>The sun is beautiful, and there is no desire to feel the mind off the sea.</p><p>In the middle of the place, the moon is opened with the human form.</p><p>The world is all the streets are all there.</p><p>The land of the broken light of life is a procession</p><p>Of many million men in lonely arms</p><p>On the page of the barn. All the time the sun</p><p>Is wheeling out of a dark bright ground.</p>
